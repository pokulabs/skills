# Webhooks & Inbound Configuration

Webhooks are required to receive inbound SMS and calls. Without a webhook registered, inbound events will not be delivered to your agent.

For full setup instructions, see: https://docs.pokulabs.com/poku-skill/webhook

## Supported Inbound Event Types

| Event | Fires when… |
|---|---|
| `message.received` | An inbound SMS arrives on your reserved number |
| `call.conversation.ended` | An inbound phone call arrives on your reserved number |


```json
{
  "eventType": "message.received",
  "payload": {
    "interactionId": "ia_abc123",
    "medium": "sms",
    "from": "+14155550199",

## OpenClaw Setup

To forward inbound Poku events to your OpenClaw agent, add a `hooks` mapping to `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`
Example mapping below:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "enabled": true,
    "token": "<openclaw-hooks-token>",
    "transformsDir": "~/.openclaw/hooks/transforms",
    "defaultSessionKey": "hook:ingress",
    "allowRequestSessionKey": false,
    "allowedSessionKeyPrefixes": ["hook:"],
    "mappings": [
      {
        "match": { "path": "poku" },
        "action": "agent",
        "agentId": "main",
        "sessionKey": "hook:poku",
        "wakeMode": "now",
        "name": "Poku",
        "deliver": true,
        "channel": "telegram",
        "to": "<your-telegram-id>",
        "messageTemplate": "You received a message from {{payload.payload.from}}: \"{{payload.payload.body}}{{payload.payload.summary}}\""
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

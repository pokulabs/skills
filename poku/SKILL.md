# Poku — Calls, Messages & Numbers

## Variables

- `POKU_API_KEY` *(required)* — Poku API key. If not set, see **Troubleshooting** below.
- `POKU_TRANSFER_NUMBER` *(optional)* — E.164 number to transfer calls to if the counterparty asks to speak with a human.

Never display any full command with a resolved API key in user-facing output. Mask the key if showing commands for debugging: `Bearer ***`.


## Skill Overview

Here's what you can do with Poku:

**Reserve a dedicated number** — Claim a phone number to send/receive calls and messages with.

**Make calls** — Call on your behalf, speak naturally, handle responses, and report back what happened. Calls use a female English voice by default; just ask if you'd like a male voice or different language.

**Send messages** — Send SMS messages from your dedicated number.

**Send WhatsApp messages** — Reach contacts on WhatsApp through a shared Poku WhatsApp number.

To receive inbound calls or texts, a webhook is required.

## Phone Number Format

Always use **E.164 format**: `+` then country code then number.

- `+12223334444` ✓
- `(222) 333-4444` ✗
- `222-333-4444` ✗
- `2223334444` ✗

If a human gives you a US number without a country code, confirm with them that it should be US `+1`. If not, ask the user which country and country code this number is for.

## Outbound Call or Message 

If call, use `reference/CALLS.md`  
If message, use `reference/MESSAGES.md`

Always go through each step before placing a call, NEVER skip any steps.
